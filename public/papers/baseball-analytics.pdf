Abstract:  
This project was largely focused on looking through different variables in the game of baseball. 
We focused on different variables separated into offense and defense and how they affected wins. We used 
the Lahman package which we found by researching the different datasets that RStudio came with. The 
main focus was to figure out which baseball statistics mattered most for winning games. In order to 
accomplish this, we created multiple regression models, plotted the statistics using R-script, and 
performed statistical tests. After running tests to compare offensive and defensive metrics, we found that 
runs scored had the strongest correlation with wins, while walks allowed was the strongest defensive 
metric correlated with wins. A surprising finding was that hitting home runs or triples was negatively 
correlated with wins, indicating that raw power is not the only strategy for winning (we described how 
this was the case). 
 
Our other focus was on how teams changed over time. We looked at the difference in the means 
of the significant predictors and what that meant. Interestingly, when looking at change in predictors over 
time, we saw an outlier in the 2020 season. This was likely a result of the COVID-19 pandemic which 
shut down the entire world for almost an entire year. It was a reminder that when analyzing statistics, you 
should be wary of anomalous environmental changes. Finally, we focused on how win percentages 
differed among different teams (franchises). We found that we could make indirect inferences on which 
teams might win in a match off by looking at their overall performance over a multi-decade period 
(1990-2023).  
 
Introduction: 
Baseball has long been one of the most popular sports, with team performance depending on a 
combination of factors such as offense and defense. Understanding the relationships between these factors 
can help predict team success and inform strategies. This project will analyze the “Teams” dataset from 
the Lahman package to explore how variables such as defensive and offensive stats impact team 
performance and winning percentages. The “Teams” dataset is a collection of variables which describe 
performance metrics of baseball players across multiple decades, multiple teams, and multiple leagues. 
The research question is: "What factors most significantly influence team success in baseball?" To answer 
this, we will use inferential statistics and regression models to identify key drivers of performance. 
 
 
Data Collection and Description: 
 This project will use the “Teams” dataset from the Lahman package. The dataset includes 
information on leagues from 1871 to the present. Key variables to look at include: offensive stats (Runs 
Scored (R), Home Runs (HR), and Stolen Bases (SB), etc) and defensive stats (Base on Balls (BB), 
Strikeouts (SO), and HRA (Home Runs Allowed), etc). The dataset also has data on the outcomes like 
Wins (W), making it ideal for analyzing team performance across different leagues and eras. 
 
 

 
 Although players change over time, franchises often carry a legacy that influences long-term 
trends. Thus, for this project, we decided to focus on data starting from 1990. This allows us to use the 
most current and relevant information to reflect modern information regarding baseball and statistical 
patterns. So, by narrowing the dataset to this period, we can avoid challenges like incomplete or 
inconsistent historical data. This is why focusing on recent years and selecting key variables ensures a 
meaningful and reliable analysis of how offensive and defensive metrics impact team success. 
 
The methodology used for Offensive and Defensive metrics: 
1. Data Preparation: The analysis aimed to understand how offense and defense influence wins 
using data from the Lahman package. The dataset focused on teams from 1990 onward and have 
important key metrics for both offensive and defensive performance. Before we start to analyze, 
to ensure accuracy, missing data was removed before proceeding. 
2. Data Visualization and Exploration: Scatter plots with regression lines were created to 
visualize how each metric relates to wins, making it easier to identify the strongest correlations. 
Additionally, we created a bar plot of the regression coefficients that showed which metrics had 
the greatest impact on wins. 
3. Regression Analysis: Two regression models were created: one for defense and one for offense. 
Offensive metrics (Runs Scored (R), Home Runs (HR), etc.) were analyzed alongside defensive 
metrics like (Strikeouts (SO), Home Runs Allowed (HRA), etc.).
 
 
Analysis of offensive metrics: 
To start off, the offensive metrics include Runs Scored (R), Home Runs (HR), Stolen Bases (SB), 
Hits (H), At-Bats (AB), Doubles (X2B), and Triples (X3B), with the dependent variable being team wins 
(W). 
First, we will perform a multiple linear regression to evaluate the impact of various offensive 
metrics on wins. The regression coefficients reveal both the strength and direction of each metric's 
relationship with wins. As seen in 
Offensive Figures 1 and 2, Runs Scored (R) stands out as the most 
significant predictor, with a coefficient of 0.1076. This means that for every additional run scored, the 
team’s expected wins increase by approximately 0.11. By looking at the p values, the result is highly 
significant (p < 2e-16), which means that this metric is important for increasing wins. Taking a closer look 
at Offensive Figure 3, the scatter plot shows a strong positive relationship. As the number of runs scored 
increases, there is a clear upward trend in the number of wins, which can be seen by the red regression 
line. Overall, with Runs Scored being the most important offensive metric, it’s fitting to think of the dots 
on the scatterplot like baseballs. 
Furthermore, as seen in Offensive Figures 1 and 2, Stolen Bases (SB), Hits (H), and At-Bats (AB) 
show positive and important effects on wins, with those metrics having p-values less than 0.05 and a 
coefficient of 0.023. This means that for every additional stolen base, a team's expected wins increase by 
approximately 0.023. Similarly, for every additional hit, a team's expected wins increase by approximately 
0.0280. At-Bats (AB), however, has a relatively smaller impact, with a coefficient of 0.0101. Overall, 
these metrics (SB, H, and AB) emphasize the importance of maintaining offensive opportunities. It is 
important to note that since Doubles (X2B) have a p-value greater than 0.05, they are not statistically 
significant and are therefore ignored. 
 
Interestingly, as seen in Offensive Figures 1 and 2, Triples (X3B), H (Hits), and Home Runs (HR) 
have a negative relationship and have important effects on wins, with those metrics having p-values less 
than 0.05. When you think about stats like home runs and triples, they are usually seen as key to winning 
games, big, exciting moments that fans love. But here, the data tells a different story. The regression 
shows that home runs have a coefficient of -0.0315, meaning each additional home run slightly decreases 
wins. Triples have an even stronger negative coefficient of -0.1244, and hits also show a small negative 

 
effect at -0.0280. This doesn’t mean hitting home runs or triples makes teams worse, it is more about how 
these numbers interact with other parts of the game. Metrics like runs, hits, and home runs often overlap, 
and that overlap can skew the results. Teams that primarily focus on offense might miss out on other 
important strategies, like baserunning tactics and strategies. While these results seem surprising, they 
reflect how complex winning in baseball really is and how it’s about balancing offense and not just 
making big hits. It’s a psychological factor. When a big hitter makes a significant impact, other players on 
the team might feel pressured to get the same result (hit a homerun). The pressure of following up a 
homerun is immense. Note that home runs differ from runs in that a home run is a run scored by a single 
player hitting the ball out of play and reaching home plate in one at-bat, while runs can be scored by 
advancing to home plate from any base. 
 
Lastly, as seen in Offensive Figure 2, the residual standard error (RSE) of 9.54 reflects the 
average difference between the predicted and actual number of wins. This means that, on average, the 
model’s predictions are off by about 10 wins. Considering that teams play around 162 games each season, 
this level of error is relatively small and highlights the model’s reliability. While a lower RSE would 
indicate an even better fit, this value suggests the model does a solid job of predicting team win totals 
within a reasonable margin. To summarize, as seen in 
Offensive Figure 2, the model as a whole is highly 
statistically significant, as evidenced by the F-statistic of 207.1 and a p-value less than 2.2e-16, which 
means that the offensive metrics collectively contribute to explaining team wins. Notably, Runs Scored 
(R) has the strongest positive impact, followed by Stolen Bases (SB) and Hits (H), while Triples (X3B) 
and Home Runs (HR) show significant negative relationships when controlling for other variables. This 
analysis shows the importance of consistent run production and base running over power-hitting metrics 
in predicting team success. 
 
Analysis of defensive metrics: 
First we are going to conduct a descriptive analysis for the sample that we have chosen.  
 
● SO(Strikeouts) - total number of batters the team’s pitchers strike out 
● RA(Runs Allowed) - total number of runs allowed allowed by team 
● E(Errors) - total number mistakes made by fielders that allow opposing team to advance or score 
● HRA(Home Runs Allowed) - total number of home runs allowed by a team’s pitchers 
● BB(Base on Balls) - total number of times a pitcher throws 4 balls outside the strikeout zone, 
resulting in a walk-on-base 
Now let’s look at the scatter plot of defensive metrics vs. wins. The scatterplot for SO vs. Wins as 
seen in Defensive Figure 4 shows a weak positive correlation, as indicated by the upward-sloping 
regression line with a correlation coefficient of 0.31. The upward regression line shows a weak 
relationship but indicates that teams with more strikeouts tend to win more games. In baseball, strikeouts 
are one of the key defensive metrics a team’s pitcher uses to prevent the ball from being hit into play. 
However, this weak correlation suggests that while strikeouts are helpful, other predictors may have 
stronger correlations with wins. 
The scatterplot for RA vs. Wins as seen in Defensive Figure 5 shows a weak positive correlation, 
with a correlation coefficient of 0.075. The positive regression line indicates that teams that allow fewer 
runs tend to win more games. The goal of the team is to decrease the total number of runs allowed by the 
opponent.  
The scatterplot for E vs. Wins as seen in Defensive Figure 6 shows a weak positive correlation, 
with a correlation coefficient of 0.151. The positive regression line indicates that teams with fewer errors 

 
tend to win more games. The scatterplot for HRA vs. Wins as seen Defensive Figure 7 shows a weak 
positive correlation, with a correlation coefficient of 0.1046, showing that teams who allow fewer home 
runs may have a slight advantage.  
The scatterplot for BB vs. Wins as seen in Defensive Figure 3 shows a moderate positive 
correlation, with a correlation coefficient of 0.671. The upward-sloping regression line indicates that 
teams that issue more walks tend to win more games. This may seem counterintuitive, but it is based on 
the idea that these walks are part of a team’s defensive strategy, not solely negative.  
Overall, this shows that defensive metrics like Base on Balls(BB) tend to have a stronger 
correlation to wins, showing their importance in a team's success. On the other hand, metrics such as RA, 
HRA, and E show a weaker correlation, indicating that while they do play a factor in contributing to a 
team's success, they are not the sole predictor. 
Next, we will do a regression model to look into how different defensive metrics influence the 
number of wins for a baseball team. The analysis includes Strikeouts (SO), Runs Allowed (RA), Errors 
(E), Home Runs Allowed (HRA), and Base on Balls/Walks Allowed (BB), with the dependent variable 
being team wins (W). Defensive Figures 1 and 2 shows that Base on Balls (BB) is the most significant 
predictor, with a coefficient of 0.1189. This means that for every one increase in walks allowed, the 
team’s wins increase by approximately 0.12. BB has a p-value of 2e-16 < 0.05, showing that it is highly 
significant and important to manage the number of walks allowed in order to win games. The scatter plot 
in Defensive Figure 3 supports this positive correlation, showing a positive slope with a correlation of 
0.671. The scatterplot shows that as the number of walks increases, there is an increase in the number of 
wins, as shown by the red regression line. 
In addition, Defensive Figures 1 and 2 also show that Errors (E) and Strikeouts (SO) lead to more 
wins. Both predictors each have p-values less than 0.05. Errors (E) have a coefficient of 0.069 which 
shows that for every additional increase of error, a team’s chance of winning increases by 0.069. 
Strikeouts (SO) also have a positive relationship but with a smaller coefficient of 0.013 which means that 
for every additional strikeout, wins increase by 0.013. These results show the importance and significance 
of pitching and defense during a game to increase wins. 
Interestingly, as seen in Defensive Figures 1 and 2, Runs Allowed (RA) has a significant negative 
relationship with wins, with a coefficient of -0.0499. This means that for every additional run allowed, the 
team expects their wins to decrease by 0.05. This supports the idea that limiting the number of runs is 
crucial for success in baseball. On the other hand, Home Runs Allowed (HRA) has a weaker positive 
relationship with a coefficient of 0.0224. However, it has a p-value greater than 0.05, meaning it is not as 
significant and does not strongly contribute to explaining wins. 
As seen in Defensive Figure 2, the residual standard error of 10.14 shows the average difference 
between the predicted and actual wins. This means that, on average, the model’s predictions are off by 
about 10 wins. This makes sense because a team plays more than 100 games a season, which can lead to 
errors, showing that this model is realistic and reliable. Having a lower RSE would result in a better fit 
and provide more reliability in predicting wins. 
Overall, the multiple regression model is significant, with an F-statistic of 233.38 and a p-value of 
2.2e-16, which is less than 0.05. This shows that it is useful in assessing which defensive metrics 
contribute more to wins. Walks Allowed (BB) is the best predictor and has the strongest impact on wins, 
followed by Errors (E) and Strikeouts (SO). Runs Allowed (RA) has the most significant negative 
relationship with wins. Therefore, defense is important for wins, as minimizing runs allowed and having 
good pitching can lead to team success. 

 
Comparing model fit between offense and defense: 
After analyzing both offensive and defensive metrics, we compared their respective models to see 
which one is the better predictor for predicting wins. So, we looked at which model produces a more 
significant and larger r-squared value. Based on the adjusted R-squared values, the offensive model has an 
Adjusted R-squared of 0.59, while the defensive model has an Adjusted R-squared of 0.53. The offensive 
model explains approximately 59.1% of the variability in team wins, while the defensive model explains 
approximately 53.9% of the variability in team wins. 
Although the offensive metrics used in our model produced a higher r-squared value, the 
difference between the two models is relatively small. This suggests that both offensive and defensive 
metrics play a significant role in determining the outcome of a game, and both should be considered when 
analyzing team performance. 
Franchise Comparison Section: 
Methodology: 
 In this part of our study, we changed our focus from looking at predictors for wins to looking at 
franchise teams as a whole over a chosen time period (1990-2023). In order to do this without knowing if 
the groups have similar variances we chose Welch’s two-sample t-test (Franchise Figure 3). Our main 
question was whether the average win percentage (WinPct) of one franchise—like the New York Yankees 
(NYY)—was higher than that of another franchise, such as the Boston Red Sox (BOS). The null 
hypothesis stated there would be no difference, while the alternative hypothesis suggested that one team 
had a statistically significant greater win percentage.  
To get a clearer picture, we also created visual summaries using the ggplot2 package in R. A 
boxplot (Franchise Figure 1) allowed us to see how each team’s WinPct was distributed, and another plot 
(Franchise Figure 2) showed the mean WinPct with 95% confidence intervals. These intervals give us a 
sense of how precise our estimates are, providing a range in which the “true” average likely lies. 
Analysis and Results: 
 Figure 1 shows a boxplot of WinPct for several franchises (ATL, BOS, CHC, LAD, NYY) from 
1990 to 2023. By looking at where the median line falls inside each box and how wide the boxes are, we 
can tell if a team’s performance was stable or varied a lot. A higher median WinPct suggests a stronger 
team overall, and a tighter box indicates more consistent results year after year. 
Figure 2 takes this further by plotting the mean WinPct for each franchise and including 
confidence intervals. If a team’s mean WinPct is comfortably above 0.55 and the interval is fairly narrow, 
it suggests that they enjoyed reliably strong seasons. On the other hand, if two teams’ intervals overlap a 
lot, it’s harder to claim one was truly better. 
Our Welch’s tests helped confirm what we saw visually (Franchise Figure 3): 
● NYY vs. ATL: With a p-value around 0.28, we did not see a statistically significant difference. 
NYY’s average (0.57) was a bit higher than ATL’s (0.56), but not by enough to be sure it wasn’t 
just chance. 
● NYY vs. BOS: A p-value near 0.01067 showed a significant difference, suggesting NYY’s mean 
WinPct (about 0.57) was truly higher than BOS’s (about 0.53). This aligns with the idea that 
NYY consistently outperformed BOS during this period. 
● NYY vs. CHC: With a p-value of roughly 1.83e-06, the difference was very strong. NYY’s mean 
(~0.57) topped CHC’s (~0.49) by a large margin, and the confidence interval fully supported this 
result. 

 
By combining these tests with our plots, we gained both statistical and visual insights into how 
different franchises compare to each other. The sudden drop in all of the predictors around 2020, likely 
due to the COVID-19 pandemic, shows how environmental change can cause outliers in the data. Overall, 
these methods worked together to give us a richer understanding of how teams compared over time. 
Timespan Analysis Section: 
Methodology: 
 To see how key baseball performance metrics evolved from 1990 to 2023, we used the 
statistically significant predictors discussed in the offense and defense metrics section. The predictors are 
Runs (R), Earned Run Average (ERA), Runs Allowed (RA), and Errors (E). We calculated the averages 
for these predictors across our timespan. Instead of zeroing in on specific teams, this approach lets us see 
bigger trends and shifts in the game’s overall offensive and defensive environment. 
After finding the annual averages, we reorganized the data so we could plot all four metrics 
together. Using ggplot2, we made a set of line graphs (Timespan Figure 1). We applied LOESS smoothing 
(shown as dashed lines) to highlight long-term patterns and make reading the plot less susceptible to 
misinterpretations due to short term changes. Environmental changes like new training methods, 
strategies, or regulations are highlighted better as they represent slower and more gradual change. 
Analysis and Results: 
Figure 4 breaks down each each predictor in a separate plot, making readability easy: 
● Errors (E): The red line shows a steady drop in errors over time, suggesting that fielding has 
gotten better as coaches, players, and equipment have improved. 
● Earned Run Average (ERA): The green line shows that ERA went through ups and downs. 
High ERA periods might reflect stronger hitting or less effective pitching, while low ERA phases 
hint at better pitching and tighter defense. 
● Runs (R): The blue line shows fluctuations in scoring, sometimes rising and sometimes dipping. 
These patterns could be tied to a wide assortment of changes such as player talent, ballpark 
conditions, or team strategies. 
● Runs Allowed (RA): The purple line for RA looks very similar to ERA, since runs allowed 
depend heavily on pitching and defense (since ERA the number of earned runs a pitcher allows). 
When RA is higher it means that the opposing team had a strong offense; when RA is lower, the 
team being observed likely had good performances in pitching and defense. 
Around 2020, we notice a sudden drop in these metrics, which is probably related to the 
COVID-19 pandemic. That season was shorter and less traditional, so the data from that year might not 
follow the usual patterns. 
Though we did not run formal tests on these trends, the smoothed lines help us spot important 
shifts. The pronounced decline in errors is especially noteworthy, showing a clear improvement in 
defensive play. Meanwhile, the changing values for ERA, R, and RA suggest that many factors, such as 
league rules, player development, and environmental conditions, have shaped the game’s style over the 
years. 
These observations set the stage for further questions. For example, we might look into how team 
spending or coaching techniques influence these long-term patterns. In summary, these graphs and our 
analysis provide a valuable overview of how key aspects of the game have changed since 1990, with 2020 
standing out as an unusual year due to the pandemic’s impact. 

 
Conclusion: 
 Our project aimed to figure out what really influences a baseball team’s success by looking 
closely at offensive and defensive stats from the Lahman "Teams" dataset, covering the years 1990 to 
2023. We used a combination of statistical models, visual charts, and tests to see which factors matter 
most for winning games, and also to compare how well offensive and defensive numbers predict success. 
On top of that, we looked at how these important stats vary across different teams and over time. 
The results showed a few clear takeaways. First, offensive numbers stood out, with runs scored 
being the most important predictor of wins. In our model, about 59% of the difference in teams’ win totals 
could be explained by offensive metrics. Defensive factors also mattered, though slightly less. For 
example, walks (BB) ended up being a key defensive measure that helped teams succeed. About 54% of 
the difference in wins could be explained by these defensive stats. While this gives a bit of an edge to 
offense, our findings show that both sides of the game, hitting and pitching/fielding, matter for winning. 
We also found a few surprises. For instance, hitting a lot of home runs or triples did not always 
mean more wins. This suggests that focusing too much on power hitting might not help if it’s not part of a 
well-rounded approach. Our initial guess was that offensive stats might be a bit stronger than defensive 
ones and that turned out to be true. Even though both sets of numbers were fairly close, it’s clear you 
should not ignore one side of the game. 
There were a few limitations. We only looked at one dataset and did not factor in things like 
injuries, spending, or weather, all of which can influence results. Also, while our models explained a good 
chunk of the differences in wins, there were still other unexplained factors. The unusual 2020 season, 
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, also introduced some odd data points. 
In the future, it would be interesting to dig deeper into how certain strategies, team finances, or 
coaching styles might shape performance. Adding more data, like information from other leagues or 
different eras could help us understand how the game is changing. Overall, we found that both offense 
and defense count a lot toward winning in baseball, with offense having a slight upper hand. Our findings 
remind managers and coaches that a balanced, well-thought-out approach is key to achieving lasting 
success in the sport.
